# LiveBindingsBeyond
The more I learn about and use LiveBindings, the more I like them! But not very many of them come with Delphi and I often find myself wishing there were more methods available. Then I learned how simple it was to write your own, so I decided to do that and share them with anyone else who finds them useful.

This list of custom methods will grow over time as I find need or get suggestions. I won't list them here but the source files will have XML-style code documentation that explains the purpose and syntax of each one.
