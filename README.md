# LiveBindings & Beyond
The more I learn about and use LiveBindings in Delphi, the more I like them! Sometimes I need to use custom formatting and it's nice that there are several methods available but I often find myself wishing there were more. Then I learned how simple it was to write your own, so I decided to do that and share them with anyone else who finds them useful.

This list of custom methods will grow over time as I find one I need or get suggestions. I won't list them here but the source files will have XML-style code documentation that explains the purpose and syntax of each one.
